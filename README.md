## General Introduction

_Note_: This introduction is perceived as inadequate by the author and will very likely change between April-May 2024. Nonetheless, this description serves as a working placeholder.

Contained in this introduction are some motivating remarks on possible future(s) for human reproduction and human genetic constitution. After this, the author provides a short description of the _Genetic Evolution Tournament_ (hereafter referred to as GET), which is currently under development and due to be released on [Metaculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaculus) (as a private [tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market)) somewhere between May 01-30 2024 (more mass on Late May).

[Scientific progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress#Scientific_progress) in [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics), [genetic engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering), and [assisted-reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology) continues at a rapid and accelerating pace, with current technological capabilities far exceeding those imagined by researchers and policy-makers in [biotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology) at the start of this century.

Frontier events in genetic engineering, such as the [He Jiankui affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Jiankui_affair), have required all of humanity to consider scenarios and possibilities for the modification of human biology.

Although extreme-fidelity human gene modifications (as in precisely exacting desired genetic outcomes) or, more broadly, [tools for the modification of human biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering_techniques) at a caliber similar to what we might expect to be employed in _[Brave New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World)_ or _[Gattaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca)_, are yet unrealized, developments in the aforementioned fields steer evermore towards this capacity.

Fortunately, considerable [anticipatory work in ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioethics) and governance have coincided with progress in these genetic and reproductive fronts; however, there are numerous scenarios for the future of humanity involving the trajectories of different technologies—e.g., [PGD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis) w/ [iPSCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell) or prenatal genetic engineering—that have yet to receive consideration in forecasting frameworks. Handling anticipatory blind spots and reducing uncertainty on futures involving humanity's possible genetic evolution seems important to coordination between researchers, the public, and policy-makers on directing outcomes and safeguarding certain aspects of humanity's future.

Despite the expected that most traction will occur within the [Effective Altruism](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/), [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/), and [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/) communities, GET seeks to occupy this niche (i.e., uncertainty reduction on futures involve varying levels of human-targeted DNA and assisted-reproduction technologies).

GET will ideally contribute, via the forecasts collected across its lifespan, to a broader scenario modelling effort, which might inform decision-making on the technologies and procedures involved in human genetics and reproduction in policy and at the level of the individual.

<!-- Taking a step back, we might ask: Why is human judgement forecasting (HJF) valuable? Note first that there is much more that can be said on this topic than I will cover in this paragraph (for a reasonably good reference, check out this paper). While algorithmic or semi-algorithmic (algorithms that involve human tuning or correction) forecasts often outperform HJFs across certain classes of questions for which there is data, situations in which data ready for modelling is scarce or where models have not yet reached an acceptable maturity level can benefit from HJF. Beyond the general reduction of uncertainty attainable through HJF methods, HJF has also demonstrated value in scenario analysis. Here, forecasters might first generate scenarios and then determine their plausibility, sometimes providing a final, combined forecast from the scenarios. HJF-generated scenarios can at times be more cost-effective than computational models, especially in situations where the creation of statistical models is unattainable, given resources or time-frames. -->

With respect to the forecasting platform for GET, given both Metaculus's status as a reputable human judgment forecast (HFJ) aggregator and the author's familiarity with the site, Metaculus was chosen as the site to host GET. There is precedent in public tournaments on Metaculus for incentivizing forecasters both to make clear and well-reasoned comments and to forecast truthfully and accurately. See this the [tournaments page](https://www.metaculus.com/tournaments/) on Metaculus for example tournaments.

GET currently consists of 5 question categories:

* (1) Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications
* (2) Technological Advancements and Clinical Applications
* (3) Regulatory and Policy Developments
* (4) Accessibility and Demographic Shifts
* (5) Healthcare and Insurance System Evolution.

Each category is intended to have between 15 and 25 questions, for an expected question total of between 75 to 125 questions (in reality, the question total seems likely to be closer to 125-150 questions, but this depends on how many are pruned).

To incentivize forecaster participation, there are prizes totaling 15K USD. Prizes are partitioned into a forecasting accuracy component (5k USD), with questions scored via Metaculus's default scoring procedures ([peer scores](https://www.metaculus.com/help/scores-faq/)), and a commenting component (10k USD). Within the commenting component, 2.5k USD is allocated to comments on questions that are part of the forecasting accuracy component (shorter-term questions) and 7.5k USD is allocated to comments on longer-term questions.

Beyond aggregating forecasts and scenarios via GET's questions, a reach-goal of GET is the elicitation of some engagement (commentary and or participation) from figures in academia with expertise in the science and or regulation of the technologies and procedures that are part of the fields of human genetics, genetic engineering (DNA technology generally), and assisted-reproduction. Barring this outcome, the author is still moderately confident that GET can be impactful, conditional on the completion of a retrospective analysis of the forecasts and forecast-rationales (scenarios) engendered.

The author welcomes any feedback on the tournament. Please [make an issue](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/Genetic-Evolution-Tournament/issues) for this or comment in [one of the discussion threads](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/Genetic-Evolution-Tournament/discussions).
