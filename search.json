In that revolt, Prometheus had sided with Zeus. As the new king, Zeus intended to destroy and replace humankind. Prometheus frustrated this plan, showing humans the use of fire, which Prometheus had stolen. Prometheus also taught humanity the arts. For these acts of defiance, Zeus intends to punish Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the mountains of Scythia.\n\n\n\nPreface\nThis is a Quarto book.\nTo learn more about Quarto books visit https://quarto.org/docs/books.\nSection on extreme outcomes.",
