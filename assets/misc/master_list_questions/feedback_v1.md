_This documents contains the first iteration of refinement on the full list of questions that the author intends in the Genetic Evolution Tournament._

The original header on the first batch of questions:

> _This document contains the full question titles of a questions that the author intends to include in the Genetic Evolution Tournament. The author include some questions on neural implants / brain-computer inferences and has also shifted away from an exceedingly detailed approach on certain questions to one of broader scope. There is still room for improvement in this regard, though. There are many more questions than the 148 listed, if one sums by question group. There are 29 instances of `[OECD Nations]` and 102 instances of `[2030, 2040`. Since there are 38 member nations of OECD (a lot to gather data for!), this means there are at least (some date questions are not covered by the Command-F search for `[2030, 2040`)_ (29 \cdot 38) + (3 \cdot 102) = 1102 + 306 = 1408  _questions. The author proposes possibly using the top 10 most populous OECD nations or, alternatively, the 10 with the highest GDP, even though this paints a smaller picture of the world._

# Justification For OECD Nations

How to choose which of the 38 OECD nations. Top 5 by GDP. Then take another 5 at random.


# Feedback On Question Batch By Colleague

> I think selecting just one would be best when possible (binary / continuous version). Nice Qs from your DMs and great work with the overall comprehensiveness of the questions.
>
> Here are a few specific comment for several questions.
>
> 14 - Costs can be quite variable depending on the modifications so this could be underspecified
> 18 - I think there are too many here as finding out about the lawsuits will be difficult in itself
> 26 - This goes to 2075 but 21 and 23 only go to 2050
> 45 - Compared to baseline, right?
> 48 - How is enhancement defined here?
> 104 - Hard to answer
>
> How about questions on:
>
> * Genetic tourism - people will travel for treatments
> * Pushback - there are questions on public approval but how about ones on religious decrees or mass movements
> * Spread of new traits through populations? e.g. people born to genetically modified parents who themselves received no interventions
> * Changes in regulations in sports? Old records exceeded by various multiples?

# o1 Feedback Batch 02

> Repeated Questions About Percentages of Genetically Modified or Screened Births

>
> * Questions #1–5 ask for “What percentage of these nations’ populations will be born polygenically screened” in 2030, 2040, 2050, 2075, 2100.
> * Questions #53–55 also ask “What percentage of births in the following nations will incorporate some form of genetic screening by 2030, 2040, 2050?”
> * Question #27 asks “What percentages of newborns will be born using polygenic screening in the USA in [2030, 2040, 2050, 2075, 2100]?”
>
> You have multiple sets that effectively ask the same thing (“What fraction of births undergo polygenic screening?”) but in slightly different wording or focusing on slightly different sub-populations (OECD vs. USA).
>
> Suggestions
>
> * Consolidate these into fewer, clearer questions. For instance:
>     * One question for OECD: “By year X (2030, 2040, 2050, 2075, 2100), what percentage of all births in OECD nations undergo polygenic screening?”
>     * One question for the USA: “By year X, what percentage of all births in the US undergo polygenic screening?”
> * Ensure consistent phrasing:
>     * “What percentage of births in year X are polygenically screened?” is usually clearer than “What percentage of these nations’ populations will be born polygenically screened?” (which can be misread).
>
> Overlapping “Genetic Modification” Questions
>
> * Questions #6–10 ask for percentages of the population “born genetically modified” in 2030, 2040, 2050, 2075, 2100 (OECD).
> * Questions #19–23, #24–26 ask different thresholds of genetic modification (≥1000 newborns? ≥1,000,000 newborns? Over 10% of births?) in similar time frames.
> * Questions #28, #57–60, #109 also address the fraction of births that are genetically modified, in the USA, OECD, or for non-medical traits.
>
> You have at least five different ways of measuring how many births are genetically modified:
>
> * Exact percentage (#6–10, #28, #57–60, #109).
> * Whether a certain numerical threshold (1,000 or 1,000,000 births) is reached (#19–23).
> * Whether a certain percentage threshold (10%) is reached (#24–26).
> * Differences between medical vs. non-medical modifications.
> * Differences between USA vs. OECD coverage.
>
> Suggestions
>
> * If you want both numerical thresholds and percentages, merge them in a single question set:
>     * For example, “In year X, do these nations surpass (a) 1,000 births, (b) 1,000,000 births, and (c) 10% of births for genetic modification?”
> * Combine the “percentage of births” queries for medical vs. non-medical traits into a single two-part question or make it explicit:
>     * “What percentage of births in OECD nations involve genetic modifications for (a) medical indications vs. (b) elective/non-medical traits by year X?”
>
> Cost Questions Overlap
>
> * Question #13: average cost (in 2020 USD) of IVF in the US in future years.
> * Question #14: average cost (in 2020 USD) of genetic modification services in the US in future years.
> * Question #56: average out-of-pocket expense for “genetic enhancement procedures” in the US in future years.
> * Question #105: average cost (in 2020 USD) per neural implant procedure in the US.
> * Question #113: average cost (in 2020 USD) of a gene therapy treatment in the US.
>
> Each refers to a different but overlapping set of procedures (IVF vs. genetic modification vs. gene therapy vs. neural implants). However, some of these might be conflated under “genetic enhancement procedures,” and “average cost” vs. “out-of-pocket” may also overlap or conflict.
Suggestions
>
> * Separate them cleanly if you truly want cost estimates for each category (IVF, gene therapy, neural implants, etc.), but clearly define each category.
> * If “genetic modification services” and “gene therapy” are intended to be distinct, specify what is included in each so forecasters don’t confuse them.
> * Merge or cross-reference “average cost” vs. “out-of-pocket.” You could specify:
>     * “List the average total cost and the out-of-pocket expense for a gene therapy in the US by year X.”
>
> Multiple Market/Industry Size Questions
>
> * Question #90: total market cap (genetic enhancement) in OECD.
> * Question #91: total market cap (polygenic screening) in OECD.
> * Question #92–94: share of GDP from these industries.
> * Question #95: average market cap of US companies offering prenatal genetic modification.
> * Question #99: how many US companies exceed USD 1B in revenue.
> * Question #100: total VC investment (genetic engineering R&D) in OECD.
> * Question #110, #111, #141, #146, #147...: many more about R&D, revenue, budgets, or investment.
>
> You have a large set of industry- or market-focused questions that could be partially combined or streamlined.
Suggestions
>
> Group them into one or two main sections, for example:
>
> * Total Market Size and Investment
>     * “What will be the total market cap (in 2020 USD) of [genetic enhancement / gene therapy / neural implants] across OECD by year X?”
>     * “What will be total annual VC investment in these fields by year X?”
> * Share of GDP / Healthcare Budgets
>     * “What percentage of OECD GDP (or healthcare budgets) will these fields represent by year X?”
> * Number of Large Companies
>     * “How many companies in [the US / OECD] will exceed USD 1B in annual revenue from these fields by year X?”
>
> Clinical Trials / Studies Questions
>
> * Questions #67–88: how many clinical trials will be underway for genetic enhancements (each trait listed) in OECD in future years.
> * Similarly #78–88 specifically about polygenic screening for different traits.
> * Questions #49, #50: how many demographic studies on genetic engineering or polygenic screening.
>  Questions #65, #66: how many studies in the US on effects on cognitive abilities.
> * Question #139: what percentage of global gene therapy research publications come from OECD?
>
> You have extensive duplication of “How many clinical trials for X trait by Y year?” repeated for many traits (strength, longevity, intelligence, etc.), plus multiple questions about publications, demographic studies, or research share.
Suggestions
>
> * Consolidate the trait-specific questions (#67–88) into a smaller table or matrix:
>     * “In 2030 / 2040 / 2050 / 2075, how many clinical trials (or at which phase) will be underway in OECD nations for: intelligence, cardiovascular health, disease resistance, etc.?”
> * For “studies” or “publications,” consider merging into one question about research volume:
>     * “How many peer-reviewed studies or demographic analyses on genetic enhancements (for any trait) will be published by year X?”
>     * Or maintain separate categories (clinical trials vs. academic studies vs. demographic studies) but avoid duplicating the same question for 10–15 different traits.
>
> Overlapping Insurance Coverage and Regulatory Bodies
>
> * Questions #29–31 and #48, #135: how many insurers in the US will cover certain enhancements by year X?
> * Questions #34–35: how many regulatory bodies will be established by 2050 or 2075?
> * Question #18: how many lawsuits…?
> * Questions #36–37, #61–63: adoption rates among various US demographics.
>
> All revolve around infrastructure: coverage, regulation, lawsuits, adoption rates. But they sometimes overlap or might be partially answered by the same data.
Suggestions
>
> * Combine coverage questions into a single suite, e.g.:
>   * “How many US insurance agencies (or what % of the market) will cover polygenic screening / gene therapy / etc. by year X?”
>   * Distinguish “intelligence” vs. “depression” coverage only if that difference is crucial.
> * For regulatory bodies (#34, #35), you might merge or clarify:
>     * “How many new national-level regulatory agencies or frameworks for prenatal genetic engineering will exist in OECD countries by year X?”
> * If the lawsuit question (#18) is essential, keep it. But be sure forecasters understand the difference between “how many lawsuits” and “what fraction of providers are legally challenged.”
>
> Trait-Improvement and “Conditional” Questions
>
> * Question #15: “Conditional on adoption, how will [trait] measurements change by year X in these nations?”
> * Question #16: “How much more intelligent will those screened for intelligence be?”
> * Question #17: “How much less depressed…?”
>
> These are fairly overlapping. #15 is already an umbrella question about changes in a large set of traits (intelligence, longevity, height, etc.). #16 and #17 are just narrower versions for intelligence/depression.
Suggestions
>
> * Either keep #15 as your “umbrella trait-change question” and eliminate #16 and #17 to avoid duplication, or keep #16 and #17 as stand-alone but remove them from #15’s trait list.
> * Consider combining them into a single matrix: “By year X, how do we estimate the improvement or reduction in [list of traits] for those who underwent [polygenic screening or genetic modification]?”
>
> Clarify Terminology and Scope
>
> A recurring issue is that different terms—“genetic enhancement,” “gene therapy,” “genetic engineering,” “genetic modification,” “polygenic screening,” “prenatal genetic modification,” “IVF plus screening,” etc.—are sometimes used interchangeably or are partially overlapping. Forecasters need clear definitions:
>
> * Polygenic Screening: Typically selecting among embryos (via IVF) based on polygenic scores; no direct “edit,” only selection.
> * Genetic Modification / Engineering: Directly editing the genome (via CRISPR, base editing, etc.).
> * Gene Therapy: Often refers to postnatal or in-utero therapies, typically for disease correction rather than embryo selection or modification.
> * Neural Implant: Hardware or bioelectronic device that interfaces with the brain; quite different from gene editing.
>
> Recommendation: Provide a short “Definitions” section at the start of your tournament so that every question referencing “genetic modification” or “gene therapy” is interpreted consistently.
>
> Timeframes and Consistency
>
> You often use 2030, 2040, 2050, 2075, 2100 as key years. Some questions omit certain years or add extra (e.g., 2020, 2025). Verify that you want all those time points for each question. Fewer time intervals can reduce complexity and keep the tournament more manageable.
>
> Overall Recommendations
>
> * Combine or streamline highly similar questions.
> * Ensure consistent phrasing (“% of births” vs. “% of population,” “in year X” vs. “by year X”).
> * Add a definitions/assumptions page for key terms.
> * Stick to the most decision-critical questions if 148 questions is too large.
> * Consider grouping by topic (e.g., “Adoption and Prevalence,” “Costs,” “Insurance & Regulation,” “Market & Industry,” “Clinical Trials & Research,” “Trait Improvements,” etc.) to give forecasters a logical flow.
>
> By removing redundancies and clarifying each metric (percentage, absolute number, threshold, etc.), you will make the tournament more approachable and ensure that forecasts are precise, well-defined, and non-overlapping.

# o1 Feedback Batch 01

> Watch Out for Overlapping or Nested Questions
>
> * Questions like “Will these nations have over 1000 genetically modified newborns by year X?” and “What percentage of newborns will be genetically modified by year X?” are partially redundant. Perhaps decide which style of question (absolute number vs. percentage) is more important.
>
> “Genetically modified,” “polygenically screened,” “genetic enhancement,” “gene therapy,” and “elective genetic modifications” may each have overlapping or ambiguous technical meanings. To improve data consistency and interpretability:
>
> * Briefly clarify whether “genetically modified” includes CRISPR‐based somatic changes vs. germline changes.
> * Distinguish “polygenic screening” from “selecting among embryos” vs. “editing embryo DNA.”
>
> Combine Similar Questions
>
> * There’s a lot of overlap around “How many clinical trials…for trait X in OECD nations” from #67 to #88. You could unify them into a smaller set:
>   * “How many clinical trials will be underway for [list of traits]?”
>   * Or a single question table: Rows = years, Columns = traits.
> * Likewise, the repeated questions about “percentage of births with genetic screening” vs. “percentage of births with genetic modifications” could be merged into fewer, broader questions.
>
> Several questions cover the usage of these technologies for clearly medical targets (e.g., inherited diseases) versus enhancement traits (intelligence, strength, etc.). It might help to separate them into two question blocks, so the medical vs. enhancement discussion stays focused and consistent within each category.
>
> If your goal is to forecast and scenario‐plan overall human genetic and reproductive tech adoption, you might question whether you need quite so many granular questions about every single inherited disease (cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, etc.). Instead, you could:
>
> * Combine them in a single question block: “What percentage reduction in monogenic disorders is expected in OECD nations?” or “How many inherited diseases will have widely accessible gene therapy in place by X year?”
>
> Focus vs. Redundancy
>
> * If the key story you’re telling is about the widespread adoption and economic/societal impact of gene editing vs. polygenic screening, many of the “detailed trait” questions might be folded into a smaller set (e.g., “Top 3 prevalent single‐gene disorders,” “Top 3 widely attempted enhancements”).
> * Too many granular items can fatigue participants and might not yield much incremental insight, especially if they’re forecasting the same underlying phenomenon (like “number of gene therapy trials” repeated 10 times).
>
> Key Decision
>
> Ultimately, ask yourself: “Are we trying to deeply map every possible angle on gene therapies and screening, or do we just need enough coverage to feed a few robust future scenarios?” If you want participants to form a cohesive big‐picture scenario, you could:
>
> * Trim repetitive lines about each single disorder or each single trait.
> * Use aggregated questions that still capture the difference between, say, medical disease correction and enhancement.
> * Keep a smaller set of big‐impact diseases or traits (like cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s, or intelligence, longevity) if they’re truly pivotal to your scenario.
>
> In short, there’s no universal “too much,” but the current set could feel lopsided. If your ultimate aim is scenario‐based insight, some consolidation of genetic engineering vs. polygenic screening would keep the survey more efficient and let you address other interesting frontiers (social/ethical/regulatory angles, or neural implants, or advanced fertility tech) with comparable depth.
