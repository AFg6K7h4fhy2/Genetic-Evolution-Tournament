_This document contains the full question titles of a questions that the author intends to include in the Genetic Evolution Tournament. The author include some questions on neural implants / brain-computer inferences and has also shifted away from an exceedingly detailed approach on certain questions to one of broader scope. There is still room for improvement in this regard, though. There are many more questions than the 148 listed, if one sums by question group. There are 29 instances of `[OECD Nations]` and 102 instances of `[2030, 2040`. Since there are 38 member nations of OECD (a lot to gather data for!), this means there are at least (some date questions are not covered by the Command-F search for `[2030, 2040`)_ $$(29 \cdot 38) + (3 \cdot 102) = 1102 + 306 = 1408$$ _questions. The author proposes possibly using the top 10 most populous OECD nations or, alternatively, the 10 with the highest GDP, even though this paints a smaller picture of the world._
