Until further notice, the _Genetic Evolution Tournament_ maintains a prize pool of **15K USD**.

There exists some possibility that more funding might become available in the future, so percentages are given for prize quantities.

This prize pool is allocated over several categories: {short-term, medium-term, long-term} X {commenting-prize, forecasting-accuracy-prize}.

One purpose of the tournament is to generate scenarios and discussion surrounding futures involving human enhancement via DNA and reproductive technologies; as such, comments supporting this end are incentivized via commenting prizes.

Another purpose of the tournament is to quantify uncertainty on and predict the occurrence of certain milestones in human enhancement via the aforementioned technologies; as such, accurate and truthful forecasting is incentivized via forecasting prizes.
